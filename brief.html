        <div class="intro">
            <p>Societal buy-in is crucial for any successful negotiated solution. Ukrainians bear a negative legacy of the Minsk agreements failed implementation and will need a greater effort to be persuaded to accept the potential peace deal currently under negotiation. Thus, it is crucial for the actors involved in negotiations to understand the perspectives of the Ukrainian people.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In this brief, we summarize key topics where we observe certain consensus among the general populace and Ukrainian organized civil society based on evidence from the recent national opinion polls and civil society public statements. Based on systematic conflict analysis, we have clustered the issues into seven groups:</p>
        
        <h2 id="support-leadership">Support for Ukraine's leadership and their approach to negotiations</h2>
        <p>Popular support for the Ukrainian state leadership remains high and has increased back to 65-70% after encounters between President Trump and President Zelensky in February 2025.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup></p>
        <p>Although the number of people who are comfortable with direct negotiations with Russia increases over time, it is not unconditional.<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> Negotiations and ceasefire with Russia is acceptable only under conditions of security guarantees to Ukraine, or rejection of Russian demands.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> High level of support to negotiation and ceasefire does not translate to low willingness to fight. If Ukrainian conditions are not met, Ukrainians declare that they are prepared to continue to fight even without US support.</p>
        <p>Both general public and organized civil and expert society agree that any negotiations must include Ukraine and its European allies, either in one multilateral or separate bilateral negotiation formats.<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup></p>
        <p>Ukrainian women's organizations spearhead civil society inclusion and request participation of women in negotiation delegations at all levels.<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup></p>
        
        <h2 id="security-issues">Security Issues</h2>
        <p>Temporary ceasefire can be accepted by Ukrainians without security guarantees (but without any demands from Russia as well).<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> There is consensus that any stable peace deal requires sufficient, functional security guarantees/packages from western allies, though there is no consensus on their form.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> Although NATO membership for Ukraine is still at the table, recent surveys showed higher preference for self-reliance (increased military capacity of Ukraine).<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> The option of non-NATO European deterrence contingent or peacekeeping force also gains weight.</p>
        
        <h2 id="territorial-issues">Territorial issues</h2>
        <p>Ukrainians, in line with international law, do not legally recognize the annexation of the territories occupied by Russia since 2014.<sup><a href="#ref9">9</a></sup> At the same time, de-facto Russian control of the occupied areas according to the current front line may be tolerated if stable and long-term cessation of fighting is achieved and security is guaranteed.<sup><a href="#ref10">10</a></sup></p>
        
        <h2 id="justice-issues">Justice Issues</h2>
        <p>Ukrainians desire accountability for crimes of aggression, war crimes, and other crimes that should be investigated and prosecuted by means of independent, international and national legal mechanisms.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> All surveys about negotiations omit to ask this question, indirectly confirming the GoU strategy to make accountability for the crime of aggression and war crimes non-negotiable. "Punishing those guilty of crimes" is the most important aspect of justice for Ukrainians when they are asked "what justice means to them".</p>
        
        <h2 id="humanitarian-issues">Humanitarian Issues</h2>
        <p>Any negotiated agreement should include the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a></sup> These demands reflect widespread public consensus and are seen as non-negotiable components of any acceptable peace deal.<sup><a href="#ref12">12</a></sup></p>
        
        <h2 id="economic-issues">Economic Issues</h2>
        <p>Ukrainian organized civil society claims that economic and political sanctions on Russia should not be lifted until Russia makes viable steps to halt its aggression against Ukraine as well as the occupation of Ukrainian land.<sup><a href="#ref7">7</a>,<a href="#ref5">5</a></sup></p>
        
        <h2 id="domestic-policy">Issues of Ukrainian domestic policy</h2>
        <p>Ukrainians are clearly against any elections before the fighting is over and martial law is lifted.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> Civil society details that at least 6 months will be needed after that to adopt a legal framework, restore electoral infrastructure, and guarantee competitive and democratic elections.<sup><a href="#ref13">13</a></sup></p>
        <p>Although making the Russian language a second state language as a part of the peace deal is clearly non-admissible for Ukrainians,  other options (like ethnic minority protection) may if they are not determinaed by foreign states but by Ukraine’s obligations to its citizens in accordance with international law and EU accession requirements.</p>

        <div class="key-finding">
            <h3>Key Finding</h3>
            <p>Popular support for Ukrainian state leadership, particularly President Zelensky, has <span class="highlight">increased back to 65-70%</span> after encounters between President Trump and President Zelensky in February 2025, demonstrating a "rally around the flag" effect.</p>

        <div class="data-source">Source: Rating Group, February 20-21, 2025</div>
        
        <div class="analysis-text">
            <p>The trust dynamics for President Zelensky show several distinct phases and turning points over the 2018-2025 period:</p>
            <p><strong>Pre-war period (2018-2022):</strong> After winning the presidency with high initial approval, Zelensky experienced a gradual decline in public trust, fluctuating between 25-35% during 2020-2021 as domestic reforms stalled and challenges mounted.</p>
            <p><strong>Russian Invasion (February 2022):</strong> The full-scale invasion triggered an unprecedented surge in trust, jumping from 33% to <span class="trends-up">93%</span>, the highest recorded level. This represents a classic "rally-around-the-flag" effect during an existential national crisis.</p>
            <p><strong>Sustained wartime leadership (2022-2023):</strong> Trust remained remarkably high (80-90%) throughout the first year of the war, bolstered by successful counteroffensives like the <span class="event-label">Kharkiv operation in September 2022</span>, which temporarily increased trust by 4 percentage points.</p>
            <p><strong>War fatigue period (2023-2024):</strong> A gradual erosion of trust is evident as the war extended into its second year, declining to around 62-64% by late 2024 as military progress stalled and economic difficulties persisted.</p>
            <p><strong>Post-US Election period (November 2024-January 2025):</strong> Following the US elections, trust in Zelensky showed a <span class="trends-up">slight increase</span> from 63% to 67%, possibly reflecting public hopes for new diplomatic opportunities.</p>
            <p><strong>Trump-Zelensky Meeting effect (February 2025):</strong> The diplomatic engagement between Presidents Trump and Zelensky provided a second "rally around the flag" moment, with trust increasing to <span class="trends-up">71%</span>. This suggests that Ukrainians responded positively to the potential for high-level diplomatic resolution while maintaining strong support for their leadership.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1.2 Support for direct negotiations with Russia</h2>

        <div class="key-finding">
            <h3>Key Finding</h3>
            <p>The number of Ukrainians who support direct negotiations with Russia has <span class="highlight">steadily increased</span> over 2024-2025, reaching 65% by January 2025. This trend indicates growing openness to diplomacy but not unconditional surrender.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="data-source">Source: Rating Group, February 20-21, 2025</div>
        
        <div class="analysis-text">
            <p>The timeline shows a clear evolution in Ukrainian attitudes toward direct negotiations with Russia:</p>
            <p><strong>Early 2024:</strong> At the beginning of 2024, a majority of Ukrainians (59%) opposed direct negotiations with Russia, while only 38% supported them. This reflected the prevailing sentiment that negotiations might lead to unfavorable terms.</p>
            <p><strong>Mid-2024 transition:</strong> By mid-2024, we observe a pivotal shift, with support for negotiations crossing the 50% threshold in July 2024. This coincides with the period of military stalemate and growing international pressure for diplomatic solutions.</p>
            <p><strong>Post-US Election acceleration:</strong> Following the US elections in November 2024, support for negotiations increased more rapidly, jumping from 58% to 65% by January 2025. This <span class="trends-up">27-point increase</span> over one year represents a significant shift in public opinion.</p>
            <p><strong>Opposition decline:</strong> The percentage of Ukrainians opposing negotiations has dropped by half, from 59% to 29%, indicating a growing pragmatism among the population as the war enters its fourth year.</p>
            <p>This trend aligns with the observation in the brief that support for negotiations is increasing but remains conditional on security guarantees. The data suggests Ukrainians are increasingly willing to consider diplomatic paths while maintaining resolve about their core conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1.3 Fight or negotiate? (2022-2024)</h2>

        <div class="key-finding">
            <h3>Key Finding</h3>
            <p>Public opinion has shifted significantly from 2022 to 2024. While 73% preferred to continue fighting until victory in 2022, by late 2024 a majority (52%) favored seeking negotiated solutions, showing <span class="highlight">evolving perspectives on conflict resolution</span>.</p>

        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="fight-vs-negotiate-timeline-chart"></canvas>
        </div>
        <div class="data-source">Source: Gallup Poll, November 19, 2024</div>
        
        <div class="analysis-text">
            <p>The dramatic three-year evolution in Ukrainian attitudes toward war strategy demonstrates a profound shift in public sentiment:</p>
            <p><strong>2022 (Initial invasion period):</strong> In the first year of the full-scale invasion, a substantial majority (73%) of Ukrainians favored continuing to fight until victory. This reflected the initial shock, patriotic resistance, and confidence following successful defense of Kyiv and recapture of territories in Kharkiv and Kherson.</p>
            <p><strong>2023 (Stalemate period):</strong> By 2023, support for continuing to fight remained the majority position at 63%, but had decreased by 10 percentage points. The shift reflected the reality of a protracted conflict with limited territorial gains despite significant human costs.</p>
            <p><strong>2024 (War fatigue period):</strong> The most dramatic shift occurred between 2023 and 2024, with support for fighting until victory dropping by <span class="trends-down">25 percentage points</span> to become the minority position (38%). Simultaneously, preference for negotiated solutions rose to 52%, marking a complete reversal from 2022 attitudes.</p>
            <p>This reversal represents one of the most significant shifts in Ukrainian public opinion during the war. It aligns with the brief's observation that "polls indicate shifting notions on what can ultimately be accepted as victory." The consistency in the "Don't know" category (5-10%) suggests that most Ukrainians maintained clear positions throughout this evolution.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1.4 Rejection of exclusion from negotiations</h2>

        <div class="key-finding">
            <h3>Key Finding</h3>
            <p>Ukrainians overwhelmingly reject (91%) the idea of direct negotiations between the USA and Russia without Ukraine's participation, demonstrating a strong preference for Ukraine's <span class="highlight">agency in any peace process</span>.</p>
